# envelope_cloud
Python tool to compute the envelope (alpha shape) of a 3D point cloud, save it and  save some related metrics (volume and area of the alpha shape, projected area on the ground, accuracy of the alpha shape, number of envelopes).


Only .txt files are supported as inputs for now but this can be improved with some minor modifications.

## Example

Below are two example images demonstrating the functionality of the project:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center;">
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Screenshot_cloud.png" alt="Description of Image 1" width="450"/>
    <p> Input point cloud.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Screenshot_mesh.png" alt="Description of Image 2" width="450"/>
    <p> Resulting alpha-shape for a given alpha value, along with the projected surface on the ground. </p>
  </div>
</div>


## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
